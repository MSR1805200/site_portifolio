      <description>The present work aims to predict what is known as particulate matter. These particles, more precisely the PM 2.5 are very fine and can be found in fog or smoke, that is to say that the more of these particles appear, the more polluted is local.
The work can be divided into 7 parts:
  Data collect;
  Data division;
  Data pre-processing;
  Exploratory analysis;</description>
